_Since this is my first time coding in zig, I have decided to make something useful, while keeping it barebones and somewhat crude, hence the logo._

## Available Flags

- `-l` / `-L` (followed by a number 2–10) _defines the length_  
- `-f` / `-F` (followed by a letter) _defines the first letter_  
- `-v` / `-V` _prints the current version_  
- `-h` / `-H` _shows the help message_

#### `-l` and `-f` are order-independent but cannot be grouped (yet).
